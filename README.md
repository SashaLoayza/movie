App dev course final project

The app allows users to track and rate movies that they have watched. They can also keep track of movies they
are interested in. We also added a community feature where users can find movies that are being shown in the 
Cornell community. Users can also choose to host movies.

The app is hosted on a Google Cloud Server under this IP address: http://34.124.115.253/
